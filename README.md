# Repository Demonstrating the Working of AI based XRAY Image Enhancement Algorithm 
## Funded by [DIGIRAY](http://m.digiray.co.kr/page/page29)

## Description
Image Enhancement algorithm developed for enhancing xray images. Available commercially via [Digiray]().
Key Features : 
* Light-Weight : Real Time performance on Modest Computational Resources
* Unsupervised : No paired training data is needed
* Blind : The methods is scalable to unknown images. (Check the results below)
